      All photos on this site follow strict photojournalistic rules for editing:
    </p>
    <ul class="rulesList">
      <li>
        <b>Allowed:</b> Exposure and other contrast adjustments. White balance
        and tint adjustments. Color to B&W conversion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Minor adjustments allowed:</b> Sharpening, saturation, noise
        reduction, local adjustments of color and contrast.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disallowed:</b> AI upscaling, AI noise reduction, spot healing, dust
        removal, geometric corrections, panoramic stitching, HDR image merging,
        artificial blurring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Not recommended:</b> Lens correction: often makes noise look worse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In general, the rules allow for changes that happen on an individual pixel
      level, but not changes that alter the pixel structure. The only exceptions
      being mild noise reduction to improve web compression, and
      manufacturer-standardized lens corrections because it can be considered an
      alternative native rendering of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local adjustments of color should never be adjusted to a degree where the
      color of a person or an object becomes misleading in terms of what that
      object looks like in real life. That said, cameras never capture the world
      exactly like our eyes and the viewer should assume that no pictorial
      representation of reality will 100% match the experience of seeing
      something in real life.

      These images are published with C2PA signing to prove that the images are
      real, or at least as close to real as an image can be. To check this, you
      can download the image and check it using
      <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify"
        >this Content Credentials page</a
      >.

      Images are also published in HDR, using HDR gain maps in JPEG to be
      backwards compatible with non-HDR browsers and displays. Publishing images
      in HDR is to more closely represent the dynamic range of the real world
      where the picture was captured. What you see may still be affected by the
      projection quality of your viewing device. So far, no camera can capture
      and no display can project the true dynamic range of the real world. And
      likely never will. Still, an HDR rendering of an image is a lot closer to
      representing perceptual reality than an SDR image.
